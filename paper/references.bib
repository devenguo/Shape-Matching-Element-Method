abstract = {We introduce a simple technique that enables robust approximation of volumetric, large-deformation dynamics for real-time or large-scale offline simulations. We propose Lattice Shape Matching, an extension of deformable shape matching to regular lattices with embedded geometry; lattice vertices are smoothed by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on local lattice regions, with the effective mechanical stiffness specified by the amount of smoothing via region width. Since the na\"{\i}ve method can be very slow for stiff models - per-vertex costs scale cubically with region width - we provide a fast summation algorithm, Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FastLSM), that exploits the inherent summation redundancy of shape matching and can provide large-region matching at constant per-vertex cost. With this approach, large lattices can be simulated in linear time. We present several examples and benchmarks of an efficient CPU implementation, including many dozens of soft bodies simulated at real-time rates on a typical desktop machine.},

The method utilizes simple structured meshes of hexahedral elements that do not necessarily conform to the material interfaces in heterogeneous materials. By avoiding the creation of conforming meshes used in conventional FEM, the NIGFEM leads to significant simplification of the mesh generation process. To achieve an accurate solution in elements that are crossed by material interfaces, the NIGFEM utilizes Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to enrich the solution field locally. The accuracy and convergence of the NIGFEM are tested by solving a benchmark problem. We observe that the NIGFEM preserves an optimal rate of convergence, and provides additional advantages including the accurate capture of the solution fields in the vicinity of material interfaces and the built-in capability for hierarchical mesh refinement. Finally, the use of the NIGFEM in the computational analysis of heterogeneous materials is discussed."

Both the volume and the surface representation are point based, which allows arbitrarily large deviations form the original shape. In contrast to previous point based elasticity in computer graphics, our physical model is derived from continuum mechanics, which allows the specification of common material properties such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio.In each step, we compute the spatial derivatives of the discrete displacement field using a Moving Least Squares (MLS) procedure. From these derivatives we obtain strains, stresses and elastic forces at each simulated point. We demonstrate how to solve the equations of motion based on these forces, with both explicit and implicit integration schemes. In addition, we propose techniques for modeling and animating a point-sampled surface that dynamically adapts to deformations of the underlying volumetric model.},

abstract = {We present a new shape-matching deformation model that allows for efficient handling of topological changes and dynamic adaptive selection of levels of detail. Similar to the recently presented Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FLSM), we compute the position of simulation nodes by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on many overlapping regions, but we rely instead on octree-based hierarchical sampling and an interval-based region definition. Our approach enjoys the efficiency and robustness of shape-matching deformation models, and the same algorithmic simplicity and linear cost as FLSM, but it eliminates its dense sampling requirements. Our method can handle adaptive spatial discretizations, allowing the simulation of more degrees of freedom in arbitrary regions of interest at little additional cost. The method is also versatile, as it can simulate elastic and plastic deformation, it can handle cuts interactively, and it reuses the underlying data structures for efficient handling of (self-)collisions. All this makes it especially useful for interactive applications such as videogames.},

abstract = {We propose a method to design linear deformation subspaces, unifying linear blend skinning and generalized barycentric coordinates. Deformation subspaces cut down the time complexity of variational shape deformation methods and physics-based animation (reduced-order physics). Our subspaces feature many desirable properties: interpolation, smoothness, shape-awareness, locality, and both constant and linear precision. We achieve these by minimizing a quadratic deformation energy, built via a discrete Laplacian inducing linear precision on the domain boundary. Our main advantage is speed: subspace bases are solutions to a sparse linear system, computed interactively even for generously tessellated domains. Users may seamlessly switch between applying transformations at handles and editing the subspace by adding, removing or relocating control handles. The combination of fast computation and good properties means that designing the right subspace is now just as creative as manipulating handles. This paradigm shift in handle-based deformation opens new opportunities to explore the space of shape deformations.},

Our methodology is used for soft tissue deformation in character animation. The algorithm is based on a novel discretization of corotational elasticity over a hexahedral lattice. Within this framework we enforce positive definiteness of the stiffness matrix to allow efficient quasistatics and dynamics. In addition, we present a multigrid method that converges with very high efficiency. Our design targets performance through parallelism using a fully vectorized and branch-free SVD algorithm as well as a stable one-point quadrature scheme. Since body collisions, self collisions and soft-constraints are necessary for real-world examples, we present a simple framework for enforcing them. The whole approach is demonstrated in an end-to-end production-level character skinning system.},

abstract = {We propose a simple yet efficient multigrid scheme to simulate high-resolution deformable objects in their full spaces at interactive frame rates. The point of departure of our method is the Galerkin projection which is simple to construct. However, a na\"{\i}ve Galerkin multigrid does not scale well for large and irregular grids because it trades-off matrix sparsity for smaller sized linear systems which eventually stops improving the performance. Given that observation, we design our special projection criterion which is based on skinning space coordinates with piecewise constant weights, to make our Galerkin multigrid method scale for high-resolution meshes without suffering from dense linear solves. The usage of skinning space coordinates enables us to reduce the resolution of grids more aggressively, and our piecewise constant weights further ensure us to always deal with reasonably-sparse linear solves. Our projection matrices also help us to manage multi-level linear systems efficiently. Therefore, our method can be applied to different optimization schemes such as Newton's method and Projective Dynamics, pushing the resolution of a real-time simulation to orders of magnitudes higher. Our final GPU implementation outperforms the other state-of-the-art GPU deformable body simulators, enabling us to simulate large deformable objects with hundred thousands of degrees of freedom in real-time.},
