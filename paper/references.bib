abstract = {We present a new approach for simulating deformable objects. The underlying model is geometrically motivated. It handles pointbased objects and does not need connectivity information. The approach does not require any pre-processing, is simple to compute, and provides unconditionally stable dynamic simulations.The main idea of our deformable model is to replace energies by geometric constraints and forces by distances of current positions to goal positions. These goal positions are determined via a generalized shape matching of an undeformed rest state with the current deformed state of the point cloud. Since points are always drawn towards well-defined locations, the overshooting problem of explicit integration schemes is eliminated. The versatility of the approach in terms of object representations that can be handled, the efficiency in terms of memory and computational complexity, and the unconditional stability of the dynamic simulation make the approach particularly interesting for games.},

abstract = "The most popular approaches for the simulation of dynamic systems in computer graphics are force based. Internal and external forces are accumulated from which accelerations are computed based on Newton’s second law of motion. A time integration method is then used to update the velocities and finally the positions of the object. A few simulation methods (most rigid body simulators) use impulse based dynamics and directly manipulate velocities. In this paper we present an approach which omits the velocity layer as well and immediately works on the positions. The main advantage of a position based approach is its controllability. Overshooting problems of explicit integration schemes in force based systems can be avoided. In addition, collision constraints can be handled easily and penetrations can be resolved completely by projecting points to valid locations. We have used the approach to build a real time cloth simulator which is part of a physics software library for games. This application demonstrates the strengths and benefits of the method."

abstract = {We introduce a simple technique that enables robust approximation of volumetric, large-deformation dynamics for real-time or large-scale offline simulations. We propose Lattice Shape Matching, an extension of deformable shape matching to regular lattices with embedded geometry; lattice vertices are smoothed by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on local lattice regions, with the effective mechanical stiffness specified by the amount of smoothing via region width. Since the na\"{\i}ve method can be very slow for stiff models - per-vertex costs scale cubically with region width - we provide a fast summation algorithm, Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FastLSM), that exploits the inherent summation redundancy of shape matching and can provide large-region matching at constant per-vertex cost. With this approach, large lattices can be simulated in linear time. We present several examples and benchmarks of an efficient CPU implementation, including many dozens of soft bodies simulated at real-time rates on a typical desktop machine.},

abstract = {We introduce an efficient technique for robustly simulating incompressible objects with thousands of elements in real-time. Instead of considering a tetrahedral model, commonly used to simulate volumetric bodies, we simply use their surfaces. Not requiring hundreds or even thousands of elements in the interior of the object enables us to simulate more elements on the surface, resulting in high quality deformations at low computation costs. The elasticity of the objects is robustly simulated with a geometrically motivated shape matching approach which is extended by a fast summation technique for arbitrary triangle meshes suitable for an efficient parallel computation on the GPU. Moreover, we present an oscillation-free and collision-aware volume constraint, purely based on the surface of the incompressible body. The novel heuristic we propose in our approach enables us to conserve the volume, both globally and locally. Our volume constraint is not limited to the shape matching method and can be used with any method simulating the elasticity of an object. We present several examples which demonstrate high quality volume conserving deformations and compare the run-times of our CPU implementation, as well as our GPU implementation with similar methods.},

abstract = {We introduce a unified optimization framework for geometry processing based on shape constraints. These constraints preserve or prescribe the shape of subsets of the points of a geometric data set, such as polygons, one-ring cells, volume elements, or feature curves. Our method is based on two key concepts: a shape proximity function and shape projection operators. The proximity function encodes the distance of a desired least-squares fitted elementary target shape to the corresponding vertices of the 3D model. Projection operators are employed to minimize the proximity function by relocating vertices in a minimal way to match the imposed shape constraints. We demonstrate that this approach leads to a simple, robust, and efficient algorithm that allows implementing a variety of geometry processing applications, simply by combining suitable projection operators. We show examples for computing planar and circular meshes, shape space exploration, mesh quality improvement, shape-preserving deformation, and conformal parametrization. Our optimization framework provides a systematic way of building new solvers for geometry processing and produces similar or better results than state-of-the-art methods. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The underlying idea is to use oriented particles that store rotation and spin, along with the usual linear attributes, i.e. position and velocity. This additional information adds substantially to traditional particle methods. First, particles can be represented by anisotropic shapes such as ellipsoids, which approximate surfaces more accurately than spheres. Second, shape matching becomes robust for sparse structures such as chains of particles or even single particles because the undefined degrees of freedom are captured in the rotational states of the particles. Third, the full transformation stored in the particles, including translation and rotation, can be used for robust skinning of graphical meshes and for transforming plastic deformations back into the rest state.},

This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.},

abstract = {Abstract The FE-simulation of inhomogeneous structures, such as composite materials, biological tissues or foams, requires the generation of respective finite element meshes. With increasing complexity of the inner architecture of such structures, this becomes a time-consuming and laborious task. Additionally, the risk of forming bad-shaped elements that may lead to ill-conditioned numerical problems grows significantly. A solution to this problem provides the extended finite element method (XFEM). Thereby, the interface between different materials is represented by a local enrichment of the displacement approximation. As a consequence of this, the element boundary need not be aligned to the interface. In order to improve the accuracy of the interface approximation, the development of a plane element based on the XFEM and quadratic shape functions will be presented. This element allows for the description of curved material interfaces. The computation of the element stiffness matrix requires a numerical integration process that accounts for discontinuous fields. Regarding a linear element formulation, this can be achieved by an adapted triangulation of the element domain. However, in the case of a curved interface this solution is not applicable. Hence, non-uniform rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are used to evaluate the integrals numerically. Finally, the results of different examples will show the general properties such as the accuracy of the numerical integration procedure and the convergence behavior of this element formulation.

The presented method utilizes generalized degrees of freedom and enrichment functions based on NURBS to capture the solution with non-conforming meshes. A consistent method for the generation and application of the NURBS-based enrichment functions is introduced. These enrichment functions offer various advantages including simplicity of the integration, possibility of different modes of local solution refinement, and ease of implementation. In addition, we show that these functions well capture weak discontinuities associated with highly curved material interfaces. The convergence, accuracy, and stability of the method in the solution of two-dimensional elasto-static problems are compared with the standard finite element scheme, showing improved accuracy. Finally, the performance of the method for solving problems with complex internal geometry is highlighted through a numerical example. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

By avoiding the creation of conforming meshes used in conventional FEM, the NIGFEM leads to significant simplification of the mesh generation process. To achieve an accurate solution in elements that are crossed by material interfaces, the NIGFEM utilizes Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to enrich the solution field locally. The accuracy and convergence of the NIGFEM are tested by solving a benchmark problem. We observe that the NIGFEM preserves an optimal rate of convergence, and provides additional advantages including the accurate capture of the solution fields in the vicinity of material interfaces and the built-in capability for hierarchical mesh refinement.

In contrast to previous point based elasticity in computer graphics, our physical model is derived from continuum mechanics, which allows the specification of common material properties such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio.In each step, we compute the spatial derivatives of the discrete displacement field using a Moving Least Squares (MLS) procedure. From these derivatives we obtain strains, stresses and elastic forces at each simulated point. We demonstrate how to solve the equations of motion based on these forces, with both explicit and implicit integration schemes. In addition, we propose techniques for modeling and animating a point-sampled surface that dynamically adapts to deformations of the underlying volumetric model.},

The first section introduces FEM deformable-object simulation and its fundamental concepts, such as deformation gradient, strain, stress, and elastic energy, discusses corotational FEM models, isotropic hyperelasticity, and numerical methods such as conjugate gradients and multigrid. The second section presents the state of the art in model reduction techniques for real-time FEM solid simulation. Topics include linear modal analysis, modal warping, subspace simulation, domain decomposition, and which techniques are suitable for which application.},

abstract = {Geometry processing of surface meshes relies heavily on the discretization of differential operators such as gradient, Laplacian, and covariant derivative. While a variety of discrete operators over triangulated meshes have been developed and used for decades, a similar construction over polygonal meshes remains far less explored despite the prevalence of non-simplicial surfaces in geometric design and engineering applications. This paper introduces a principled construction of discrete differential operators on surface meshes formed by (possibly non-flat and non-convex) polygonal faces. Our approach is based on a novel mimetic discretization of the gradient operator that is linear-precise on arbitrary polygons. Equipped with this discrete gradient, we draw upon ideas from the Virtual Element Method in order to derive a series of discrete operators commonly used in graphics that are now valid over polygonal surfaces. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our resulting operators through various numerical examples, before incorporating them into existing geometry processing algorithms.},

abstract = {As demands for high-fidelity physics-based animations increase, the need for accurate methods for simulating deformable solids grows. While higherorder finite elements are commonplace in engineering due to their superior approximation properties for many problems, they have gained little traction in the computer graphics community. This may partially be explained by the need for finite element meshes to approximate the highly complex geometry of models used in graphics applications. Due to the additional perelement computational expense of higher-order elements, larger elements are needed, and the error incurred due to the geometry mismatch eradicates the benefits of higher-order discretizations. One solution to this problem is the embedding of the geometry into a coarser finite element mesh. However, to date there is no adequate, practical computational framework that permits the accurate embedding into higher-order elements.We develop a novel, robust quadrature generation method that generates theoretically guaranteed high-quality sub-cell integration rules of arbitrary polynomial accuracy. The number of quadrature points generated is bounded only by the desired degree of the polynomial, independent of the embedded geometry. Additionally, we build on recent work in the Finite Cell Method (FCM) community so as to tackle the severe ill-conditioning caused by partially filled elements by adapting an Additive-Schwarz-based preconditioner so that it is suitable for use with state-of-the-art non-linear material models from the graphics literature. Together these two contributions constitute a general-purpose framework for embedded simulation with higher-order finite elements.We finally demonstrate the benefits of our framework in several scenarios, in which second-order hexahedra and tetrahedra clearly outperform their first-order counterparts.},

abstract = {This article develops a dynamic generalization of the nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) model. NURBS have become a defacto standard in commercial modeling systems because of their power to represent free-form shapes as well as common analytic shapes. To date, however, they have been viewed as purely geometric primitives that require the user to manually adjust multiple control points and associated weights in order to design shapes. Dynamic NURBS, or D-NURBS, are physics-based models that incorporate mass distributions, internal deformation energies, and other physical quantities into the popular NURBS geometric substrate. Using D-NURBS, a modeler can interactively sculpt curves and surfaces and design complex shapes to required specifications not only in the traditional indirect  fashion, by adjusting control points and weights, but also through direct physical manipulation, by applying simulated forces and local and global shape constraints. D-NURBS move and deform in a physically intuitive manner in response to the user's direct manipulations. Their dynamic behavior results from the numerical integration of a set of nonlinear differential equations that automatically evolve the control points and weights in response to the applied forces and constraints. To derive these equations, we employ Lagrangian mechanics and a finite-element-like discretization. Our approach supports the trimming of D-NURBS surfaces using D-NURBS curves. We demonstrate D-NURBS models and constraints in applications including the rounding of solids, optimal surface fitting to unstructured data, surface design from cross sections, and free-form deformation. We also introduce a new technique for 2D shape metamorphosis using constrained D-NURBS surfaces.},

In this method, moving least-squares interpolants are used to construct the trial and test functions for the variational principle (weak form); the dependent variable and its gradient are continuous in the entire domain. In contrast to an earlier formulation by Nayroles and coworkers, certain key differences are introduced in the implementation to increase its accuracy. The numerical examples in this paper show that with these modifications, the method does not exhibit any volumetric locking, the rate of convergence can exceed that of finite elements significantly and a high resolution of localized steep gradients can be achieved. The moving least-squares interpolants and the choices of the weight function are also discussed in this paper.},

Similar to the recently presented Fast Lattice Shape Matching (FLSM), we compute the position of simulation nodes by convolution of rigid shape matching operators on many overlapping regions, but we rely instead on octree-based hierarchical sampling and an interval-based region definition. Our approach enjoys the efficiency and robustness of shape-matching deformation models, and the same algorithmic simplicity and linear cost as FLSM, but it eliminates its dense sampling requirements. Our method can handle adaptive spatial discretizations, allowing the simulation of more degrees of freedom in arbitrary regions of interest at little additional cost. The method is also versatile, as it can simulate elastic and plastic deformation, it can handle cuts interactively, and it reuses the underlying data structures for efficient handling of (self-)collisions. All this makes it especially useful for interactive applications such as videogames.},

Deformation subspaces cut down the time complexity of variational shape deformation methods and physics-based animation (reduced-order physics). Our subspaces feature many desirable properties: interpolation, smoothness, shape-awareness, locality, and both constant and linear precision. We achieve these by minimizing a quadratic deformation energy, built via a discrete Laplacian inducing linear precision on the domain boundary. Our main advantage is speed: subspace bases are solutions to a sparse linear system, computed interactively even for generously tessellated domains. Users may seamlessly switch between applying transformations at handles and editing the subspace by adding, removing or relocating control handles. The combination of fast computation and good properties means that designing the right subspace is now just as creative as manipulating handles. This paradigm shift in handle-based deformation opens new opportunities to explore the space of shape deformations.},

The method is based on the solution of a small linear system based on a simplified variant of the moment-fitting equations. Numerical experiments suggest that the accuracy of the resulting quadrature rules exceeds the accuracy of traditional methods by orders of magnitude. Using moments up to an order of p, the measured experimental orders of convergence exceed hp. Consequently, their construction is very efficient because only coarse computational grids are required. The conceptual simplicity allows for the application on very general grid types, which is demonstrated by numerical experiments on quadrilateral, triangular and hexahedral grids.

abstract = {Summary We present a higher order discretization scheme for the compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations with immersed boundaries. Our approach makes use of a discontinuous Galerkin discretization in a domain that is implicitly defined by means of a level set function. The zero iso-contour of this level set function is considered as an additional domain boundary where we weakly enforce boundary conditions in the same manner as in boundary-fitted cells. In order to retain the full order of convergence of the scheme, it is crucial to perform volume and surface integrals in boundary cells with high accuracy. This is achieved using a linear moment-fitting strategy. Moreover, we apply a non-intrusive cell-agglomeration technique that averts problems with very small and ill-shaped cuts. The robustness, accuracy, and convergence properties of the scheme are assessed in several two-dimensional test cases for the steady compressible Euler and Navier–Stokes equations. Approximation orders range from 0 to 4, even though the approach directly generalizes to even higher orders. In all test cases with a sufficiently smooth solution, the experimental order of convergence matches the expected rate for discontinuous Galerkin schemes. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {In computer graphics, simulated objects typically have two or three different representations, a visual mesh, a simulation mesh and a collection of convex shapes for collision handling. Using multiple representations requires skilled authoring and complicates object handing at run time. It can also produce visual artifacts such as a mismatch of collision behavior and visual appearance. The reason for using multiple representation has been performance restrictions in real time environments. However, for virtual worlds, we believe that the ultimate goal must be WYSIWYS -- what you see is what you simulate, what you can manipulate, what you can touch.In this paper we present a new method that uses the same representation for simulation and collision handling and an almost identical visualization mesh. This representation is very close and directly derived from a visual input mesh which does not have to be prepared for simulation but can be non-manifold, non-conforming and self-intersecting.},

abstract = {Abstract A new continuous reproducing kernel interpolation function which explores the attractive features of the flexible time-frequency and space-wave number localization of a window function is developed. This method is motivated by the theory of wavelets and also has the desirable attributes of the recently proposed smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, moving least squares methods (MLSM), diffuse element methods (DEM) and element-free Galerkin methods (EFGM). The proposed method maintains the advantages of the free Lagrange or SPH methods; however, because of the addition of a correction function, it gives much more accurate results. Therefore it is called the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM). In computer implementation RKPM is shown to be more efficient than DEM and EFGM. Moreover, if the window function is C∞, the solution and its derivatives are also C∞ in the entire domain. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on the 1D diffusion equation reveal the stability conditions and the effect of the dilation parameter on the unusually high convergence rates of the proposed method. Two-dimensional examples of advection-diffusion equations and compressible Euler equations are also presented together with 2D multiple-scale decompositions.},

abstract = {A new method to simulate deformable objects with heterogeneous material properties and complex geometries is presented. Given a volumetric map of the material properties and an arbitrary number of control nodes, a distribution of the nodes is computed automatically, as well as the associated shape functions. Reference frames attached to the nodes are used to apply skeleton subspace deformation across the volume of the objects. A continuum mechanics formulation is derived from the displacements and the material properties. We introduce novel material-aware shape functions in place of the traditional radial basis functions used in meshless frameworks. In contrast with previous approaches, these allow coarse deformation functions to efficiently resolve non-uniform stiffnesses. Complex models can thus be simulated at high frame rates using a small number of control nodes.},

abstract = {We present a new type of deformable model which combines the realism of physically-based continuum mechanics models and the usability of frame-based skinning methods. The degrees of freedom are coordinate frames. In contrast with traditional skinning, frame positions are not scripted but move in reaction to internal body forces. The displacement field is smoothly interpolated using dual quaternion blending. The deformation gradient and its derivatives are computed at each sample point of a deformed object and used in the equations of Lagrangian mechanics to achieve physical realism. This allows easy and very intuitive definition of the degrees of freedom of the deformable object. The meshless discretization allows on-the-fly insertion of frames to create local deformations where needed. We formulate the dynamics of these models in detail and describe some precomputations that can be used for speed. We show that our method is effective for behaviors ranging from simple unimodal deformations to complex realistic deformations comparable with Finite Element simulations. To encourage its use, the software will be freely available in the simulation platform SOFA.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm for near-interactive simulation of skeleton driven, high resolution elasticity models. Our methodology is used for soft tissue deformation in character animation. The algorithm is based on a novel discretization of corotational elasticity over a hexahedral lattice. Within this framework we enforce positive definiteness of the stiffness matrix to allow efficient quasistatics and dynamics. In addition, we present a multigrid method that converges with very high efficiency. Our design targets performance through parallelism using a fully vectorized and branch-free SVD algorithm as well as a stable one-point quadrature scheme. Since body collisions, self collisions and soft-constraints are necessary for real-world examples, we present a simple framework for enforcing them. The whole approach is demonstrated in an end-to-end production-level character skinning system.},

abstract = "Delaunay refinement is a technique for generating unstructured meshes of triangles for use in interpolation, the finite element method, and the finite volume method. In theory and practice, meshes produced by Delaunay refinement satisfy guaranteed bounds on angles, edge lengths, the number of triangles, and the grading of triangles from small to large sizes. This article presents an intuitive framework for analyzing Delaunay refinement algorithms that unifies the pioneering mesh generation algorithms of L. Paul Chew and Jim Ruppert, improves the algorithms in several minor ways, and most importantly, helps to solve the difficult problem of meshing nonmanifold domains with small angles. Although small angles inherent in the input geometry cannot be removed, one would like to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. A compromise is necessary. A Delaunay refinement algorithm is presented that can create a mesh in which most angles are 30° or greater and no angle is smaller than arcsin[(3/2)sin(φ/2)]∼(3/4)φ, where φ⩽60°is the smallest angle separating two segments of the input domain. New angles smaller than 30° appear only near input angles smaller than 60°. In practice, the algorithm's performance is better than these bounds suggest. Another new result is that Ruppert's analysis technique can be used to reanalyze one of Chew's algorithms. Chew proved that his algorithm produces no angle smaller than 30° (barring small input angles), but without any guarantees on grading or number of triangles. He conjectures that his algorithm offers such guarantees. His conjecture is conditionally confirmed here: if the angle bound is relaxed to less than 26.5°, Chew's algorithm produces meshes (of domains without small input angles) that are nicely graded and size-optimal."
