\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new method for direct physics-based animation of volumetric curved models, represented using NURBS surfaces.  
Our technical contribution is the Shape Matching Element Method (SEM).
SEM is a completely meshless algorithm, the first to simultaneously 
be robust to gaps and overlaps in geometry, 
be compatible with standard constitutive models and time integration schemes, support contact and frictional interactions  
and to preserve feature correspondence during simulation which enables editable simulated output. 
We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by producing compelling physics-based animations from a variety of curved input models.
